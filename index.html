                <h1>The LGBT community has become home to an insidious new form of homophobia.</h1>

<ul>
    <li><p>It has been <b>enabled by the redefinition of homosexuality</b> from <b>same sex</b> attraction to attraction based on <b>self-identified gender</b>.</p>

    <li><p>This has resulted in <b>gays and lesbians being pressured to include the opposite sex in their dating pools</b> so they are not seen to be 'bigoted' or 'exclusionary'.</p>

    <li><p>The new homophobia is <b>enabled by institutions, LGBT news outlets and charities that formerly fought for gay rights</b>, and is evident in <b>hateful online rhetoric from self-proclaimed 'progressives'</b>.</p>

    <li><p>This has resulted in <b>gays and lesbians being banned from dating apps</b> for saying they're same sex attracted, <b>single sex lesbian events being banned</b> in otherwise progressive states, and in extreme cases, <b>sexual assault</b>.</p>
</ul>

<h2>So, how did this happen?</h2>
<h3>The difference between sex and gender</h3>
<p>All this starts with sex and gender, terms that are sometimes considered to mean the same thing. <b>Biological sex is made up of two categories - male and female</b> - which are central to the reproduction of all mammals. In humans, <b>males typically have XY chromosomes</b>, a penis and prostate, etc. and have evolved to produce spern. <b>Females typically have XX chromosomes</b>, a vagina and uterus etc. and have evolved to produce eggs.</p>

<p><b>Trans rights activists assert</b> there is a <b>difference between sex and gender</b>. They say that <b>while sex is biological, gender is a social construct - a set of ideas that can be changed</b>. Gender could refer to <b>gender roles and stereotypes</b> - ideas about what men and women are or should be - for example, the ideas that men are assertive and women submissive. Gender could also refer to <b>gendered presentation</b> (e.g. men wear pants and women wear dresses and make up). It could also refer to <b>gender identity</b> - <b>one's own internal sense of whether they are a man, woman or something else.</b></p>

<h2>What is trans?</h2>
<p>A small number of people have a mental condition called <b>gender dysphoria</b>, where they are distressed by their sexed body. They are treated with hormones and surgery to make them resemble the opposite sex. These people are traditionally known as transsexuals. For example, <b>a trans woman is someone whose sex is male but lives/identifies as a woman</b>. <b>Trans rights activists prefer the term 'transgender'</b>, which refers to <b>anyone who identifies as something other than their sex, regardless of whether they have gender dysphoria</b> or have had hormones/surgery to resemble the opposite sex. <b>According to trans rights activists, trans women (who are biologically male) are women</b> and trans men (biological females) are men. <b>Anyone who questions this is labelled</b> a fascist, bigot, <b>transphobe, TERF or even a Nazi</b>.</p>

<h2>How does this impact gay rights?</h2>
<h3>Erasure</h3>
<p><b>Trans rights activists are seeking to replace sex with self-proclaimed 'gender identity'</b>, and have <b>already got these changes into law</b> in some countries. <b>Allowing someone to live their lives in a way that is authentic to them is a good thing, but asking people to ignore sex</b> entirely presents <b>many problems</b>. For starters, <b>homosexuality is based on same sex attraction</b>. Many institutions, including <b>governments, LGBT charities and universities, have redefined homosexuality as "same gender" attraction</b>, which is <b>inaccurate</b> - <b>by this definition, penis in vagina sex is gay sex if both people identify as men</b>. It also <b>erases the lived experience of lesbians, gays and bisexuals</b>, who are same <b>SEX</b> attracted.</p>

<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p><b>If homosexuality is same gender attraction</b>, <b>a gay man would want</b> a relatiomship with <b>a biological female</b> (with a vagina) who <b>identifies as a man</b>, right? <b>If trans women are women, why would a lesbian</b> (woman attracted to women) <b>exclude trans women</b> (<b>many of whom keep their penises</b>) <b>from her dating pool?</b></p>

<p><b>This redefinition of homosexuality allows gays' and lesbians' exclusive same sex attraction to be framed as bigotry.</b> It might sound insane, but <b>many LGBT outlets and trans right activists</b> online have framed it this way, sometimes even <b>comparing gays' and lesbians' sexuality to racist dating preferences</b>. There are also <b>thousands of hateful comments</b> online from people who claim to be progressive, and if you take away the progressive language, <b>many resemble old fashioned homophobia.</b></p>

<p><b>If there's anything we should've learnt from the gay rights movement, it's that you can't choose who you're attracted to</b>, and - with the obvious exceptions like rape and pedophilia - <b>you shouldn't be shamed for it, expected to ignore it, or expected to hide it.</b></p>
